# 🍳 Odin Recipes  

A delicious little project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).  
This is a simple yet foundational exercise in writing clean, semantic HTML while learning how to structure and link multiple pages.

## 🥘 Overview  
**Odin Recipes** is a minimal recipe website built entirely with **HTML**.  
The goal: build a homepage that links to several individual recipe pages — each containing a mouth-watering image, a brief description, an ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions.  

It’s simple on the surface, but it’s all about the fundamentals:  
- Folder structure  
- Relative links  
- Semantic HTML tags  
- Project organization  
- Version control with Git and GitHub
