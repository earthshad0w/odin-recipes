    <p><em>This Miso Salmon is marinated in a sweet and savory miso sauce and broiled until the outside is beautifully crisp and the inside is perfectly moist. 
        It’s even better when you serve the fish with Japanese ginger rice. You‘ll make it a staple in no time.</em></p>

    <p>Salmon is truly one of the best choices of fish out there! I love that the fish is readily available, extremely versatile, and makes a healthy protein for any meal. Today, I’m excited to share one of my favorite go-to recipes that’s quick and full of savory flavor: Miso Salmon (味噌サーモン).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            2 skin-on salmon fillets (¾ lb, 340 g; ideally, less than 1 inch or 2.5 cm thick; 4–6 oz or 113–170 g per fillet)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Marinade</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp miso (use any type of miso; I used Hikari Miso Organic White Miso)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Garnish</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ tsp toasted white and black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 green onion/scallion (chopped)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Before You Start: </strong>Please note that this recipe requires a marination time of 1–2 hours.</li>        
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. Check your <strong>2 skin-on salmon fillets</strong> for scales and tiny bones.</li>        
        <li><strong>To find bones</strong>, run your fingers along the flesh and sides, then pull them out with fish boning tweezers.</li>        
        <li><strong>To check for scales</strong>, run your fingers over the fish skin and scrape them off with the flat edge of a knife.</li>        
        
    </ol>

    <h3>To Marinade</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl or flat tray, mix the marinade ingredients: <strong>2 Tbsp miso, 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and ¼ tsp toasted sesame oil.</strong></li>        
        <li>If your salmon isn’t cut into fillets, slice it into individual portions (about <strong>6 oz / 170 g</strong> each) for quicker, more even cooking. Place the pieces in the marinade, skin side up.</li>        
        <li>Spoon the marinade over the salmon, coating the flesh, sides, and skin. Cover and refrigerate for <strong>1–2 hours</strong> for fillets up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, or <strong>up to 3 hours</strong> for thicker cuts.</li>        
    </ol>

    <h3>To Broil</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>PREHEAT: </strong>Turn the broiler to High (550ºF/290ºC) and place a rack in the center, <strong>9 inches (23 cm)</strong> from the top heating element. Preheat for 5 minutes.</li>        
        <li>Cut the green onions diagonally into thin slices. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (since parchment paper will burn) and spray or brush the oil so the salmon skin won‘t stick.</li>        
        <li><strong>Remove all excess marinade before broiling, as miso burns easily.</strong></li>
        <li>Place the salmon <strong>skin side down</strong> on the prepared baking sheet.</li> 
        <li>Broil the salmon for about <strong>10–13 minutes</strong> or until the thickest part of the fillet reaches 125–130°F (52–54ºC). No need to flip the salmon. For medium-rare, stop cooking at 120ºF (49ºC).</li> 
    </ol>

    <h3>To Bake</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>PREHEAT: </strong>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220ºC) with a rack placed in the center position. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove all excess marinade before baking, as miso burns easily.</strong></li>
        <li>Place the salmon <strong>skin side down</strong> on the prepared baking sheet. If using an oven probe, insert it into the thickest part of the fillet.</li>
        <li>Bake the salmon for about <strong>18–20 minutes,</strong> or until the thickest part of the fillet reaches 125–130°F (52–54ºC). No need to flip the salmon. For medium-rare, stop cooking at 120ºF (49ºC).</li>
        <li>Remove the salmon from the oven and check doneness by flaking the flesh—it’s ready if it flakes easily.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To Serve</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Serve the Miso Salmon and top with <strong>½ tsp toasted white and black sesame seeds</strong> and <strong> green onion/scallion</strong> 1 thinly sliced (both toppings are optional). I like to serve this salmon with Ginger Rice. Enjoy!</li>
