        <p><em>Blanched spinach dressed in a savory nutty sesame sauce, this Japanese Spinach Salad with Sesame Dressing (Gomaae) is a healthy veggie side dish that goes well with everything.</em></p>

        <p>One of the mainstays of the Japanese vegetable side dish is the “Goma-ae (胡麻和え).” We would blanch all sorts of vegetables and dress them in a fresh-made sesame sauce. The most popular one is spinach gomaae, or what we call Horenso no Gomaae (ほうれん草の胡麻和え).</p>

        <p>Goma (胡麻) in Japanese means sesame seed and we call dishes dressed with sesame sauce goma-ae (胡麻和え). The word ae (pronounced as [ah EH]. 和え) comes from the verb aeru ([ah EH ru]. 和える) which is to dress (the food with sauce).

        There are many kinds of gomaae using different vegetables. In addition to spinach, gomaae can also be made with green beans, broccoli, broccolini, chrysanthemum leaves, and more. It is a lively approach that elevates everyday vegetables into something truly tasty.

        I absolutely enjoy gomaae as it takes minutes to make and complements well with any style of Japanese food. I think it’s fabulous with other Asian meals too. And if you find your bento lunch needing some colors and boost of nutrition, gomaae will make the perfect addition.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>For the Sauce</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp <strong>sugar</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Spinach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (for blanching)</li>
            <li>1 bunch spinach (8 oz, 227 g)</li>
        </ul>
     </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of cold water with ice cubes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>To Make the Sauce</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Even though your sesame seeds are pre-toasted, we will freshly toast them now to enhance their nutty aroma. Add 3 <strong>Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</strong> to an ungreased frying pan and turn on the stove to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, lift it up and shake it constantly over the flame. Toss and turn over the sesame seeds in the pan to evenly toast them. When they are fragrant, turn off the heat and move the pan off the stove.</li>
            <li>Transfer the toasted sesame seeds to a mortar (suribachi). Grind them with a pestle (surikogi). Leave some seeds whole for texture.</li>        
            <li>To the ground sesame seeds, add <strong>1 Tbsp soy sauce</strong> and <strong>1 Tbsp sugar</strong> and mix it all together. Set aside.</li>        
        </ol>
    
        <h3>To Cook the Spinach</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, add <strong>1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.</strong> Add <strong>1 bunch spinach</strong> to the boiling water, <strong>stem side first</strong>, and cook for <strong>20 seconds</strong>, as the stems take longer to cook</li>        
            <li>Then, gently push the leafy part into the water and cook for 30–45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer the spinach from the pot and plunge it into the iced bath to stop the cooking for <strong>1 minute.</strong></li>        
        </ol>

        <h3>To Assemble</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, collect the spinach and squeeze the water out. <strong>Tip: </strong>Do not leave the spinach in the water for too long or else it will lose nutrients</li>        
            <li>Cut the spinach into 1-inch (2.5 cm) lengths and put it in the mortar. If your mortar is small, transfer the sesame dressing and spinach to a bowl.</li>        
            <li>Toss it all together. Serve at room temperature or chilled.</li>
        </ol>
